        <br>
        § 1.2.1 If Friend #1 starts playing guitar, Friend #2 is required to issue frequent supportive statements such as: "Now we're grooving!" "You're making that thing talk, friend!" and "You sound even better than Blues Traveler!" </p>
        <p>§ 1.3 If Friend #1 is going through a breakup, Friend #2 must break up with their own significant other so that both Friend #1 and Friend #2 can hit the town together looking for new love. </p>
        
        <h2>ARTICLE 2: HELPING EACH OTHER</h2>
        <p>§ 2.1 Whenever Friend #1 needs to move, Friend #2 will help. </p>

        <p>§ 5.1 Both parties agree that friendships can't be one-sided. Friendships must be based on mutual concern and loyalty. Therefore, if Friend #2 is being a jerk, you'd better believe Friend #1 is going to bring it up and throw it right back in Friend #2's face. </p>
