This is a website made with only h tags!
You can write your thoughts here
Or rant about whatever grinds your gears
Like that Jeremy guy, for example
I mean, like what is his deal?
Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...

This exercise is about nesting div tags

This div contains this text and the div tag below.
Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs
Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.

This exercise is about making lists

Here's what I like about lists:

They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
That's about it
I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
When you make a list, do it in this order:

Decide if it's an ordered list or not
If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
You've got this, I believe in you!
 

4. 

Lines. So many lines.


I'm sorry...

5. 

Here's a couple ways you can express yourself

If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here
If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag
If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag
You did it! You should be proud of yourself

yOu DiD iT! yOu ShOuLd Be PrOuD oF yOuRsElF
